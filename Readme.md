Performance Metrics Implementation:
This repository contains custom implementations of various performance metrics for evaluating classification and regression models. The metrics are calculated and demonstrated on different datasets.

Contents:
Classification Metrics
Custom implementation of precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and AUC for classification models.
Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the usage of classification metrics on multiple datasets (df_a, df_b, and df_c).
Regression Metrics
Custom implementation of Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (RÂ²), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for regression models.
Jupyter Notebook showcasing the application of regression metrics on the df_d dataset.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
NumPy
pandas
tqdm (for progress bars in threshold calculation)
